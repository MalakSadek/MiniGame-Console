# Mini Game Console
A mini-game system implemented in C for a Basys Board ðŸ•¹ ðŸ”Œ (2018)

There are two game modes, a mode where the user was presented with a fact or incorrect statement and they had to guess whether it was true or false, and a mode where the user was presented with a pattern that they had to copy using the flip switches on the board before the timer ran out. 

The final score of the user was calculated and sent using a WiFi module to a MySQL database on a remote server using PHP scripts and the user was informed if they had a high-score. 

The system makes use of the Baysis board's flip switches, console buttons, RBG LED, normal LEDs, UART and I2C ports.
